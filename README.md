# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts student academic performance using machine learning models based on demographic and academic factors. The goal is to analyze how different factors influence student scores and build predictive models for performance estimation.

The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains student information including:

- Gender
- Race/Ethnicity group
- Parental level of education
- Lunch type
- Test preparation course completion
- Math score
- Reading score
- Writing score

Each record represents a student’s academic performance.
